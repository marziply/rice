# Rice configuration

Personal Arch Linux dot files. Feel free to use or modify for your own use.

Some configuration is encrypted for private information. The
[attributes](/.gitattributes) documents these private files.

My Neovim configuration is a submodule to a
[separate repository](https://github.com/marziply/vimrc) as there are some
environments of mine that don't require the full system configuration defined
here.
